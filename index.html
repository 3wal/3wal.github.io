        <h3>Healthy Diet</h3>
        <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition.It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</p>
        <p>A healthy diet comprises a combination of different foods. These include:</p>
        <ul id="sectionOneId">
          <li>Staples like cereals (wheat, barley, rye, maize or rice) or starchy tubers or roots (potato, yam, taro or cassava).</li>
          <li>Legumes (lentils and beans).</li>
          <li>Fruit and vegetables.</li>
          <li>Foods from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs and milk).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here is some useful information, based on WHO recommendations, to follow a healthy diet, and the benefits of doing so.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Breastfeed babies and young children:</dt>
          <dd>A healthy diet starts early in life - breastfeeding fosters healthy growth, and may have longer-term health benefits, like reducing the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing noncommunicable diseases later in life.</dd>
          <dd>Feeding babies exclusively with breast milk from birth to 6 months of life is important for a healthy diet. It is also important to introduce a variety of safe and nutritious complementary foods at 6 months of age, while continuing to breastfeed until your child is two years old and beyond.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit:</dt>
          <dd>They are important sources of vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, plant protein and antioxidants.</dd>
          <dd>People with diets rich in vegetables and fruit have a significantly lower risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Eat less fat:</dt>
          <dd>Fats and oils and concentrated sources of energy. Eating too much, particularly the wrong kinds of fat, like saturated and industrially-produced trans-fat, can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.</dd>
          <dd>Using unsaturated vegetable oils (olive, soy, sunflower or corn oil) rather than animal fats or oils high in saturated fats (butter, ghee, lard, coconut and palm oil) will help consume healthier fats.</dd>
          <dd>To avoid unhealthy weight gain, consumption of total fat should not exceed 30% of a person's overall energy intake.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Limit intake of sugars:</dt>
          <dd>For a healthy diet, sugars should represent less than 10% of your total energy intake. Reducing even further to under 5% has additional health benefits.</dd>
          <dd>Choosing fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks such as cookies, cakes and chocolate helps reduce consumption of sugars.</dd>
          <dd>Limiting intake of soft drinks, soda and other drinks high in sugars (fruit juices, cordials and syrups, flavoured milks and yogurt drinks) also helps reduce intake of sugars.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Reduce salt intake:</dt>
          <dd>Keeping your salt intake to less than 5h per day helps prevent hypertension and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke in the adult population.</dd>
          <dd>Limiting the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (soy sauce and fish sauce) when cooking and preparing foods helps reduce salt intake.</dd>

             Your behaviors during the day, and especially before bedtime, can have a major impact on your sleep. They can promote healthy sleep or contribute to sleeplessness.
             Your daily routines – what you eat and drink, the medications you take, how you schedule your days and how you choose to spend your evenings – can significantly impact your quality of sleep. Even a few slight adjustments can, in some cases, mean the difference between sound sleep and a restless night. Completing a two-week sleep diary can help you understand how your routines affect your sleep.
             The term “sleep hygiene” refers to a series of healthy sleep habits that can improve your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. These habits are a cornerstone of cognitive behavioral therapy, the most effective long-term treatment for people with chronic insomnia. CBT can help you address the thoughts and behaviors that prevent you from sleeping well. It also includes techniques for stress reduction, relaxation and sleep schedule management.
             If you have difficulty sleeping or want to improve your sleep, try following these healthy sleep habits. Talk to your doctor if your sleep problem persists. You also can see help from the sleep team at an AASM accredited sleep center.<br></p>

               <li>Practice stress management techniques.</li>
             </ul>


            <p></p>
              <dl>
              <dt><b>1. Establish a morning routine</b></dt>
              <dd>Try to start your morning the same way each day. This could mean taking a short walk to move around before sitting at your desk or it could mean starting your day by reading a book for professional development. Meditation can be a great practice to start your morning with. Meditation has been shown to increase concentration, improve your mood and combat any stress and anxiety you may be feeling.</dd>
              <dt><b>2. Keep your to-do list short</b></dt>
              <dd>Keep your to-do list short and focus on three to five important and challenging tasks for the day, your most important tasks that, once completed, will make you feel highly productive. Focus on these tasks one at a time before moving on to less important tasks.</dd>
              <dt><b>3. Establish a closing routine</b></dt>
              <dd>Just as you have a routine for starting your day, you should also have a routine for the end of your day, as it will position you for a great start in the morning. Start by making a list of the top three of five things you want to do the next day. When you're finished, straighten up your desk and put away any items that are out of place. You may also want to back up your computer.</dd>
              <dt><b>4. Block your calendar</b></dt>
              <dd>Block off your calendar when you need to focus on work. This will give you the time to get your work accomplished while ensuring your day is free from unanticipated distractions.</dd>
              <dt><b>5. Respond quickly</b></dt>
              <dd>Get in the habit of responding to people right away. If you open an email that requires a response, take the time to respond right away so the task is off your list immediately. If you tell someone that you'll get back to them about something, try to get back to them within 24 hours.</dd>
              <dt><b>6. Measure your results, not your time</b></dt>
              <dd>Keep an ongoing list of everything you accomplish during a day. This will help you feel motivated and accomplished. This list makes it easy to celebrate your accomplishments and better anticipate how long similar tasks will take in the future.</dd>
              <dt><b>7. Enhance your communication skills</b></dt>
              <dd>Make strengthening your communication and collaboration skills a priority. Start by working on your active listening skills and staying on-task and on-topic when you're communicating with someone. For example, when you're writing an email to a coworker keep the email short and to the point.</dd>
              <dt><b>8. Make meetings productive</b></dt>
              <dd>Meetings are often necessary, and when this is the case, go into them with a plan. Have an outline for what you want to cover during the meeting and the desired outcome. Keep the meeting as brief and productive as possible and end with action items.</dd>
              <dt><b>9. Work in 90- to 120-minute blocks</b></dt>
              <dd>Research has shown that your brain is best able to focus for 90 minutes at a time. Consider taking more breaks and dividing your day into 90-minute or two-hour segments. This will help you maximize your brain's natural ability to focus and improve your overall productivity. Also, make sure that you adhere to your break schedule and remain focused on your work during your 90-minute work periods. It's a good idea to close your email and place your phone on silent at these times.</dd>
              <dt><b>10. Focus on one task at a time</b></dt>
              <dd>Studies have shown that when you switch from one task to another, you actually waste time because of the time it takes your brain to switch tasks and change its focus. Resist the impulse to multi-task and, instead, focus all of your attention on one task until it's complete or you're ready to move on for the time.</dd>
              <dt><b>11. Set short deadlines</b></dt>
              <dd>Parkinson's Law says that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. While you should always set reasonable deadlines for your work, consider setting shorter windows of time for completing tasks. This tactic will often increase the efficiency with which you're able to accomplish them.</dd>
              <dt><b>12. Practice stress management techniques</b></dt>
              <dd>Practice stress management techniques like reading, meditating, listening to music or practicing yoga. These strategies can combat the stress that can impact your physical, emotional and mental health and improve your workplace performance.</dd>
